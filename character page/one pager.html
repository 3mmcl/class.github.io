            <h2>About - Pre-Apocalypse</h2>
            <hr>
                <p>Born in Macon Georgia, 1966, Lee grew up alongside his brother who worked at the family pharmacy. Lee himself went on to become a history professor at the University of Georgia, and to marry. Due to work, his wife was often away for significant periods of time, which also led to a fracture in their relationship when Lee wanted a family but her job made it unfeasible. He'd work at the University of Georgia for six years before one day he came home sick and discovered his wife sleeping with a state senator. Lee was enraged and ended up killing the senator in a fight, which the player may later have him claim was an accident but it's undetermined if this is true.</p>
            <h2>About - Post-Apocalypse</h2>
            <hr>
                <p>Lee was being transported to prison when the apocalypse began, the driver crashing the car. Lee was able to escape from the crash and the zombified officer, fleeing over a fence where he would find Clementine. He takes Clemintine under his care, and the two head off. They encounter two men in the city and are brought to a farm where they encounter Kenny and his family. After getting kicked off the farm when Lee failed to save the farmers son, they head back into the town and are saved by a group hiding out in a corner store. One of the members gets a heart attack, so Lee leads a fraction of them to the pharmacy his family used to run. There he finds his zombified brother, giving a few parting words before they return to the corner store with the medicine. Their barricades are broken down and the group flees to a motel where they hide out until they run out of rations. Two brothers with a dairy approach the motel seeking gas, offering to trade food. Lee's group agree but eventually it's revealed the dairy family are cannibals. After a confrontation, Lee and co. leave.</p>
                <p>Their journey to Savannah for a boat continues, with allies gained and lost along the way, but when they arrive the docks are empty. Clementine goes missing, seeking out her parents through the mysterious stranger on the other end of her radio. Lee hunts down the stranger and saves Clementine, the two covering themselves in zombie guts to travel through a horde. They take safety in a garage, and the season ends in a heartbreaking tragedy.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr>
                <p>Though most major decisions and dialogue is up to the player, Lee's automatic responses display him as an intelligent and reasonable man. He takes up the role of the leader the groups he's been a part of, with the members generally looking to him for his opinion and guidance. However, evident in both his backstory and his present day dialogue, Lee is easily agitated and has a tendency to let his temper get the best of him, especially when his people, particularly Clementine, are put at risk or threatened. His protectiveness is usually the cause of his aggressive and sometimes violent actions, but he remains a compassionate and altruistic man.</p></div>
